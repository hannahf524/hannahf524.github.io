    <p>
    The basic idea of Markov chains is that you can model different states of a system, 
    as well as the probability of transitions between each state.
    For our purposes, consider that each <i>system</i> is a hunk of text. 
    In this hunk of text, each word or phrase is a different <i>state</i>. 
    A <i>transition</i> from state A to state B indicates that the word 
    in state A is directly followed by the word in state B somewhere in the text.
